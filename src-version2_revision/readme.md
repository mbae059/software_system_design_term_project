Basically all files have been modified so when writing a report, be sure to compare all the files

# Caution
There are some files added

- ElevatorControllerKind.java
- ElevatorDirection.java

I am a bit worried about these changes because those were integer number indication the kind or the direction.

If these integer numbers are used when incrementing or decrementing, we would have to add a few functions.
