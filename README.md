What we have to do
=============


step 1
---------
- change variable name for readability

- Time : 1~2 hours


step 2
--------
- use subclass or interface instead of if/switch statements
- apply strategy/template pattern

- Time : 4~5 hours

step 3 
--------
### reduce redundancy
- remove duplicate code/blocks

### reduce disharmony
- consistency in naming
- consistency in coding style

### decouple dependency
- break down into smaller classes or functions (similar to step 2?)
- use DIP

- Time : 4~5 hours

step 4
--------
- organize into packages

- Time : 2~3 hours

How to...
=================
- Understanding Code - 1 hour, but everyone has to do this - essential
- One person does all and the other 2 guys just makes PPT -> not good
- Maybe 15 hours

- Use zoom meeting and we do it together -> inefficent but fair and the best plan
- Maybe 20 hours

- Meet in person
- Maybe 00 hours
